William White played cornerback for The Ohio State University from 1983-87 before an 11-year career in the National Football League from 1988-1998. He played six seasons with the Detroit Lions from 1988 to 1993, three seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs from 1994 to 1996, then two seasons with the Atlanta Falcons from 1997 to 1998. He started in Super Bowl XXXIII for the Atlanta Falcons.

White played in 170 NFL games, started in 132, and racked up 672 tackles and 20 interceptions.

White currently works for Trazer, a computer-based technology company that creates a program aimed at helping people recover from athletic injuries. He is married and has three children, ages 33, 18 and 16. White’s son, Brendon, is a sophomore safety for OSU this year.
White was involved with AIA at Ohio State and continued to be active with AIA in the NFL.

White is receiving edaravone treatments from the OSU Wexner Medical Center. Edaravone is a drug recently approved by the FDA that will not cure ALS but rather slow down the progression of the disease.

“I told my kids that it’s in God’s hands,” White says. “For the time being I’m just going to keep living my life like I was before and see what God has in store for me.”
