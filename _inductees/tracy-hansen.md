Tracy Hanson started playing golf at age nine. She had a successful All-American collegiate golf career at San Jose State University that included 11 individual tournament wins, an NCAA team championship, a USGA Public Links Championship, and Low Amateur honors at the USGA Women’s Open.

In August 1993, Tracy played her first year professionally in 13 different countries, was Order of Merit Winner in Asia and Rookie of the Year on the Ladies European Tour. She enjoyed 15 successful seasons on the Ladies Pro Golf Tour before retiring in 2009.

Tracy attended the AIA Ultimate Training Camp in the 90’s and went on an AIA-sponsored golf mission trip to Kenya.

Tracy was co-winner with Nancy Scranton of the 2003 Daytona Beach Kiwanis Foundation Humanitarian of the Year Award.

Now Tracy plays in several Pro-Am charity events throughout the year and uses her expertise to teach others about the game of golf. 

Tracy desires to use her experience and hard-earned wisdom to help young women deal with the emotional demands and spiritual challenges of playing golf professionally by coaching and mentoring young players.

She facilitates trips to the Holy Land, writes monthly devotionals for Links Players International and is a guest writer for redtentliving.com. Tracy is a trained leader for Open Hearts Ministry Journey groups and has completed the Allender Center Lay Counseling Certificate Program.
