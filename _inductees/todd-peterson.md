J. Todd Peterson is the interim CEO and Chairman Emeritus of Seed Company, a world leader in accelerated Scripture translation. As president and CEO of Seed Company since February 2014, he directs a staff of 270. Seed Company has partnered with more than 900 other agencies to cumulatively impact more than 1,100 language groups over the last 20 years.

Peterson was drafted in 1993 by the NY Giants, leading to a 13-year career in the NFL where he also played for Seattle, Kansas City, San Francisco and Atlanta.  He set a number of team records and two NFL records – one of which is since broken (most 40-plus-yard field goals in a season).  He was named NFL True Value Man of the Year for the Seahawks in 1996 and twice received the NFL Players Association Byron “Whizzer” White award for excellence in character and leadership on his teams. He was twice nominated for the NFL’s Bart Starr Award. Peterson retired in 2006 as one of only 34 players to score over 1,000 points. He is the only player in NFL history to make game-winning field goals for five or more different teams. During his career he served three different terms on the NFLPA’s board.

Peterson lettered in football at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1988 and 1989 before transferring to the U. of Georgia. He graduated with a BBA in banking and finance in 1993 and was honored his senior season as the university’s first GTE Academic All-America in a decade.

The Petersons like to help families with influence and resources leverage those assets most effectively. They enjoy traveling with others to see missional opportunities and desire to see their peers experience the joy of giving.  

Peterson also serves on several boards, including Global Generosity Movement, Passion Conferences, the Young Life Foundation, and as chairman for Pro Athletes Outreach.  Peterson and his wife, Susan, live in North Atlanta and have two children.
