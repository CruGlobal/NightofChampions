In 2011, Hunt was named chairman of the international committee and joined the league’s finance committee. This past year, Hunt was one of six NFL owners to serve on the Los Angeles relocation committee.

Hunt graduated first in his class at Southern Methodist University in 1987, and was a two-time recipient of the university’s highest academic honor, the Provost Award for Outstanding Scholar. He was named one of the SMU Cox School of Business outstanding young alumni in 2004, and in 2005, he was appointed to the Cox School executive board of trustees. Hunt currently serves on the SMU board of trustees.
